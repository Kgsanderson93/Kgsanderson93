ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Iâ€™m Kayla Sanderson (@Kgsanderson93), an undergraduate researcher and AI-focused software engineer!**

Currently, Iâ€™m contributing to the *Rosie Project* at NC State, where we're developing a language-independent pattern-matching language as an alternative to Regex. This role has allowed me to work on prototyping in Lua and transition the final build to C for optimized performance. Iâ€™ve led feature design, created a formal proof of operational semantics, and developed a custom test suite that achieved 95% branch coverage, significantly enhancing the reliability of our system.

In addition to my work on Rosie, I had the opportunity to present my findings in *Moving Beyond Parsing Expression Grammars* at the [SouthEast Regional Programming Languages Seminar](https://the-au-forml-lab.github.io/SERPL/events/2023/) in Augusta, GA. You can find the abstract [here](https://the-au-forml-lab.github.io/SERPL/events/2023/abstracts/Moving_Beyond_Parsing_Expression_Grammars.pdf).

ðŸ’» **Skills**: C, Lua, Python, Java, MySQL, Angular, and Spring Boot.  
ðŸ“‚ **Projects**: Check out my repositories for more on my work and interests!

**Letâ€™s connect if you're interested in AI solutions, pattern-matching languages, or innovative software development!**
